        <p class="a">Recently I have been playing a role-playing game called Genshin Impact and it revolves around a world called Teyvat. In the beginning of the game, there are a pair of twins named Aether and Lumine who travel together like stars in the sky. One day, they came upon Teyvat which was a place they were not familiar with.Teyvat at the time was experiencing a time of war and so when the twins try to leave Teyvat, they are blocked by a god who protects the land. The twins fought the god, and dodged a tenfold more, but unfortunately Lumine is caught off guard and is captured by the god. Aether, on the other hand, fights off the god's attempt to capture him and is blacked out instead.</p>
        <p class="b">The war is said to take place for at least 2000 years and this is exactly how long the time skip lasts. Aether awakens on the grounds of Teyvat and to the sound of a floating fairy thing named Paimon who is saved by Aether. After this encounter, Paimon decided to accompany Aether on his adventures and act as a tour guide since Paimon is said to know all about Teyvat. The ultimate goal is for Aether is to find his sister, Lumine, and that is where the story goes.</p>
